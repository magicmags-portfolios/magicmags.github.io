        <section class="section"> <p>My name is Maggie, and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Zoology and an Associate's degree in Applied Animal Science, with a specialization in Veterinary Technology, from the University of New Hampshire. With a background deeply rooted in animal care and welfare, I am embarking on a new journey into the realm of technology.</p>
    <p>For the past four years, I've been dedicated to my role as a veterinary technician while simultaneously immersing myself in the world of coding. As a beginner front-end developer and designer, I am eager to combine my passion for creativity with my newfound technical skills.</p>
    <p>In my pursuit of excellence, I've set ambitious goals for myself. By the end of this year, I aim to transition into a rewarding career in the tech industry and build a robust portfolio showcasing my capabilities.</p>
    <p>My interests extend beyond coding; I find solace in reading, expressing myself through poetry, engaging in friendly games with peers, and cherishing moments with my beloved Pomeranians.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the objectives I aspire to achieve:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Develop a weather application to demonstrate my proficiency in front-end development.</li>
      <li>Create a Netflix clone to showcase my design and coding abilities.</li>
      <li>Construct a fully functional website from inception to completion, encompassing both front-end and back-end development.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Driven by a desire for continuous learning and growth, I am committed to honing my skills and making meaningful contributions to the tech community.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting, and I invite you to explore my journey as I embark on this exciting chapter in my career.</p>
