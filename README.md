    <h1>Me Myself and I</h1>
    <p>My name is Maggie and I have 2 pomeranians, Mattie, Blossom, and a kitty named Poppy. I went to college and majored in <strong>Zoology</strong> and got an <strong>Applied Animal Science degree in Veterinary technology.</strong>
    This is my first coding attempt to see if this is something that I can do.</p>
    <h2>Get To Know Me</h2>
    <p>In my spare time I like to read and write poetry and play games with my friends. My goal by the end of the year is to create a project for my portfolio. My goal is to switch career and break into tech.
    I like to play video games.</p>
    <h3>Things I like to achieve</h3> 
    <p>Make two other projects one app and one game. So I can have 3 projects and then I may do some freelance stuff to perfect my skills.</p>
    <p>Make the switch in careers.</p>
